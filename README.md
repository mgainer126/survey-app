Welcome to the Employee Performance Survey site.

Here you will find a little about me, and my experience.

As a product owner, as part of one of the Agile ceremonies is the Retrospective. This survey was designed to be sent to colleagues who work with the product owner, to 
solicit feedback on the product owner's performance. 

The performance metrics captured when a colleauge completes the survey, the results get stored in a database using mySQL. The Product Owner Manager 
have log in credential, to view within secured location a dashboard to view product owner performance metrics by using a GET call.
